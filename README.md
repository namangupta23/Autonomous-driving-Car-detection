# Autonomous-driving-Car-detection

This notebook is a programming exercise of the Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.ai. We will learn about object detection using the very powerful YOLO model. Many of the ideas in this notebook are described in the two YOLO papers: [Redmon et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and [Redmon and Farhadi, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242).

**We will learn to** :

- Use object detection on a car detection dataset
- Deal with bounding boxes
